==Kapenta Bots==

Kapenta bots are a method to add arbirary functionality to the chat.  Messages addressed to
a bot begin with a forwardslash

/translate en-de this is a cat

Bots should also allow a [q]uiet mode, where the result is sent only to the sender.

/translate q en-de this is a cat

Aliases can be created by wrapper

/tl en-de this is a cat
chat_bot_tl_submit($msg) { return chat_bot_translate_submit($msg); }

Bots may use session variables for continuity, for example

/translate en-de this is a cat		<-- bot stores language pair in session
/translate this is a chicken		<-- bot assumes last language pair

==API==

Kapenta chat bots expose a very simple API:

chat_bot_botname_submit($msg, $recipient) {}
----------------------------
Processes a request and returns array of XHTML on success or FALSE on failure.  Result is:

retVal['sender'] = "This text is added to the chat queue of the person who sent the request."
retVal['recipient'] = "This text is added to the chat queue of the person to whom the request was sent."



chat_bot_botname_help($msg) {}
--------------------------
Provides instructions on how to use the bot.
