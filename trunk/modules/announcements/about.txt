The announcements module provides a system to store and publicize announcements made by schools and groups.  Announcements are treated simmilarly to blog posts, but are produced by a group or organization rather than an individual user and the permissions by which they are created and maintained are tied to officers of a group, and not individuals per se.  That is, a role within the group or school carries announcement permissions with it.  Like blog posts, announcements may have comments, images, etc and are collected chronologically.

Notifications are sent to school or group members when announcements are made or revised and should show up in member's feeds.  Archives of announcements are kept indefinitely unless deleted.

Possible future changes include a tagging system and private RSS/Atom feeds.
